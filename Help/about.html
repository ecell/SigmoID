<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">SigmoID front end is a GUI application
written in Xojo (http://xojo.com) which gives it the expected look
and usability on all three supported platforms (OS X, Linux and
Windows). The GUI provides the interface for selected programmes form
the HMMER, MEME Suite and TransTerm HP, which are responsible for the
actual searches. Sequence logos are calculated by WebLogo which is
written in Python, hence Python and BioPython (version 1.64 and
above) are required. Processing of nhmmer, mast and TransTerm HP
output, sequence format conversions and adding regulatory sites to
genome annotation are implemented as </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US">separate</SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
Python scripts. The</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US">
scripts </SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">are called from the GUI,
but could easily be used separately and integrated in an annotation
pipeline if desired.  Detailed installation instructions are provided
within distributions for each platform. The source code for the whole
SigmoID application is available with GPL 2.0 license
(https://github.com/nikolaichik/SigmoID). </FONT><BR><BR>Functions:<BR>-
visualise binding site alignments with WebLogo;<BR>- extend, shorten
and mask alignments;<BR>- create hmm profiles from alignments;<BR>-
search bacterial genomes with calibrated (and uncalibrated) hmm
profiles;<BR>- annotate promoters and transcription factor binding
sites in GenBank-formatted genomes. <BR><BR>This version includes
eleven calibrated profiles (for 4 sigma factors and 7 TFs) optimised
for enterobacterial phytopathogens Pectobacterium spp. and Dickeya
dadantii. Efficiency of these profiles may decrease for other
bacteria. <BR><BR>The search for binding sites is done by nhmmer
which is expected to be installed in the default location. WebLogo
installation is required for new alignments, otherwise logos won't be
displayed, but the rest of SigmoID should work. <BR><BR>Adding
annotations to GenBank files is done by the HmmGen.py script which
could be used on its own. BioPython (version 1.64 and up) is
required. <BR><BR>At the moment SigmoID is known to work on OS X
(10.8 and 10.9) and Ubuntu (12.04 and 14.04); it may compile and run
on Windows (provided HMMER, BioPython and WebLogo are installed), but
this was not tested yet. 64 bit Ubuntu requires installation of
32-bit libraries.
