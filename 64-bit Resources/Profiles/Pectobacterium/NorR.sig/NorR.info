NorR is an enhancer-binding protein (EBP) required for transcription activation at the RpoN-dependent promoter of the norVW nitric oxide reductase operon.

The profile was built starting with six NorR binding sites from E.coli described in RegulonDB and iteratively adding Pectobacterium/Dickeya sites. 

The final profile is built from 8 non-redundant sites and their reverse complements.
