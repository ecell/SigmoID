GlrR is an enhancer-binding protein (EBP) required for transcription activation at the RpoN-dependent promoter of small RNA gene glmY. In some strains it may also regulate another sRNA gene, glmZ.

The profile was built starting with three GlrR binding sites from E.coli described in RegulonDB and iteratively adding Pectobacterium/Dickeya sites. 

The final profile is built from 14 non-redundant sites and their reverse complements.
