Primary hmm profile on the basis of the known E.coli RpoE-dependent promoters. This profile was used to search various Pectobacterium genomes, as well as Dickeya dadantii 3937 genome. Meaningful hits were manually selected to build the profile from. The final profile is built from 57 unique sequences from 9 genomes.
No experimental evidence exists for any of these promoters.
