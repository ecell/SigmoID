PgrR (ycjZ) of E. coli was proposed to be a murein peptide degradation regulator (hence the name) and its palindromic binding site was determined experimentally (doi: 10.1111/gtc.12026). A clear (although not too close) homologue of pgrR is present in Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Dickeya dadantii genomes (but not in P.carotovorum or P. wasabiae) and is preceded by a similar palindromic site.  1-2 highly similar sites are located elsewhere in front of cell envelope related genes, but these are not related to murein recycling, so the role of this regulator in Pectobacterium/Dickeya has to be verified.
This profile therefore represents a hypothetic PgrR binding site and is built from six palindromic sequences, among which three are in front of PgrR.
