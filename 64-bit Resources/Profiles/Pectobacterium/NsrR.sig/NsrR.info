NsrR is the regulator of nitrosative stress.

The profile was built starting with NsrR sites of Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 obtained from RegPrecise and scanning the genomes of Pectobacterium strains 3-2, SCRI1043, and Wpp163 as well as D.dadantii 3937.

The final profile is built from 20 sites and their reverse complements.
