Primary hmm profile built on the basis of the FliA(sigma28)-dependent E.coli promoters. This profile was used to search various Pectobacterium genomes. The promoters located in front of at least two ortologous genes from different species were used to make the final profile. The final profile is build from 96 unique sequences from 6 genomes.
These promoters have no experimental evidence.
This profile performs poorly with Dickeya genomes due to slightly differing -10 box and much less conserved -35 box in Dickeya.
