MetJ is the repressor of methionine metabolism and biosynthesis responsive to S-adenosylmethionine.

hmm profile made of 17 Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 MetJ binding sites present in regPrecise version 3.2 was extended by four bases on each sides and used to search genomes of Pectobacterium strains. 

The final profile is built from 21 nonredundant sequences from Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI 1043 and P. carotovorum 3-2.
