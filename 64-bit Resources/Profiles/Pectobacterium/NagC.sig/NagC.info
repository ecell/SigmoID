   NagC participates in regulating the phosphotransferase system to coordinate the biosynthesis of the amino sugars, D-glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine with their catabolism.
NagC is similar to Mlc and these regulators have overlapping regulons.
   This profile was built starting with RegPrecise data for Pectobacterium atrosepticum and adding matching sites from P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii.
