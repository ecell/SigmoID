Primary profile was made from 40 experimentally defined sites (and reverse complements) from Dickeya and Pectobacterium described in Rodionov et al. 2004 Microbiology 150: 3571â€“3590. Final profile is build from these sites extended by 2 bp at each side and the ones found in Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI 1043 and P.carotovorum 3-2 genomes (170 sites total).
