HyfR is an enhancer-binding protein (EBP) required for transcription activation at the RpoN-dependent promoter of the hyfABCDEFGHIJhycI hydrogenase operon.

The profile was built starting with a single HyfR binding site from E.coli described in RegulonDB and iteratively adding Pectobacterium/Dickeya sites. 

The final profile is built from 10 non-redundant sites and their reverse complements.
