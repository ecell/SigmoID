   RhiR is described in RegPrecise 3.3 as the regulator of the putative rhamnogalacturonides utilisation locus wit seven genes organised into two divergently transcribed reguons.
   This profile was built starting with two Pectobacterium atrosepticum sites present in RegPrecise and adding orthologous sites from P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii. The rhiX site in D. dadantii appears to have a one bp insertion in the middle, therefore its functionality has to be verified. As the sequences are aligned to match the single site with insertion (and therefore have gaps), MAST search will not work with this profile.
