   PdhR repressor controls genes involved in pyruvate metabolism. It has two binding sites per genome in pectobacteria.
   This profile was built starting with RegPrecise data for Pectobacterium atrosepticum and adding orthologous sites from P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii (the sites from Pectobacterium spp. are identical).
