ArcA is a dual transcriptional regulator for Anoxic redox control. It acts primarily as a negative transcriptional regulator under anaerobic conditions. ArcA represses operons involved in respiratory metabolism, including those that encode products such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt, and enzymes of the pathway for fatty acid degradation. ArcA also activates a few operons encoding proteins involved in fermentative metabolism. It has been identified as global repressor of carbon oxidation pathways. It has been suggested that the most significant role of ArcA is under microaerobic conditions, while that of FNR is under more strictly anaerobic conditions.
ArcA is a response regulator and is activated by phosphotransfer from hybrid sensor histidine kinase ArcB. Autophosphorylation of ArcB is stimulated by effectors such as d-lactate, pyruvate, and acetate. Under aerobic conditions, the autokinase activity of ArcB is inhibited by quinone electron carriers and unphosphorylated ArcB promotes the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P
It was shown that most ArcA-binding sites contain additional direct repeat (DR) elements as well as the two required for binding an ArcA dimer, and this finding provided a novel insight into how ArcA accomplish global regulation of gene expression. More than 50% of the sites have additional DR elements, and the majority of ArcA-binding sites contain three to five DR elements, predominantly at a CTC spacing of 11 bp. The variations in the number, spacing, location, and predicted strength of DR elements within the chromosomal ArcA-binding regions suggest plasticity in the architecture of ArcA-binding sites for either repressed or activated operons. These additional repeats are not taken into account by this profile, so it is expected to detect only a fraction of the true ArcA sites.

This profile was build starting with the data from Gerasimova et al. (Biophysics, Vol. 48, Suppl. 1, 2003, pp. S21â€“S25.) and iteratively adding matching sites from Pectobacterium and Dickeya genomes. The current profile is based on 33 non-redundant sites.
