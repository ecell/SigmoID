Primary hmm profile on the basis of the HrpL promoters known for Pseudomonas syringae. This profile was used to search various Dickeya dadantii  and Pectobacterium genomes. The promoters located in front of at least two ortologous genes from different species were extended to 31 bp and used to make a second profile. Species-specific sequences were added in the third iteration. The final profile is build from 63 unique sequences from 9 genomes
Experimental evidence supports HrpL-dependent expression for most of these promoters in at least one species.
