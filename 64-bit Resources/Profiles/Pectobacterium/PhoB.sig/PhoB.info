PhoB  activates expression of the phosphorus uptake and metabolism genes in response to environmental phosphate and may repress some of the genes for periplasmic proteins. This profile was built starting with E. coli sites described by Blanco et al. (Structure 10: 701â€“713. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(02)00761-x) and iteratively adding sites from Pectobacterium and Dickeya strains. The final profile is based on  17 nonredundant sites.
