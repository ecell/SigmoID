RcsB is the activator of capsule (colanic acid) and surface protein synthesis. This profile was built starting with three binding sites described for Pectobacterium carotovorum (Andersen et al., 2010; doi:10.1099/mic.0.033936-0) and iteratively adding matching sites from P. carotovorum, P. atrosepticum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii. The final profile is biult from 39 nonredundant sites from four strains.
