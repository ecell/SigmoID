<body lang="en-GB" dir="ltr"><h1 class="western">SigmoID Installation</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please donâ€™t launch SigmoID until all the
requirements listed below are satisfied! <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
Mac OS, we strongly recommend moving SigmoID.app to the Applications
folder before the first launch.   <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SigmoID
v.2 is known to work on OS X (10.10 and up) and 64-bit Linux
distributions (Ubuntu 16.04 and Mint 16 were tested).  Windows
support is possible, but not planned unless there is sufficient
interest. Other Linux distributions may work provided Xojo
requirements are met. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full list of
platform-specific system requirements is located at <a href="https://docs.xojo.com/Resources:System_Requirements">Xojo
web site</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SigmoID relies heavily on
Python and will have severely limited functionality without it. The
various python scripts included with SigmoID require python version
2.7 and will not work with version 3 yet (conversion to Python3
should be complete by the end of 2020). <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Biopython (v. 1.66+) should be installed on top of python 2.7. You
can download the distribution and read the installation details for
your system at <a href="http://biopython.org/wiki/Download">biopython.org</a>.
Please make sure you download and install the correct version for
your system and python version.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proper
installation of the MEME suite is essential for inference of new
motifs. Depending on your system set-up, MEME may require additional
python and perl modules (html output generation suffers most often
without those).  MEME within SigmoID could be called in two ways: as
a simple converter of the aligned sequences to MEME format (via the
<a href="#Convert_to_MEME">Convert to MEME</a> menu command) or for
finding binding sites within unaligned sequences (via the <a href="#Find_Sites_with_MEME">Find
Sites with MEME</a> menu command). The second option generates html
output via a perl script and relies on template files that MEME
expects to find in certain locations, hence this is only likely to
work when MEME is installed on the user system and the path to the
system version is appropriately set in SigmoID preferences.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Install <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/">OpenMPI</a> to allow MEME
and MeShClust to use multiple threads. Absence of OpenMPI will be
especially noticeable in the <i>de novo</i> TFBS inference pipeline:
meme will run in a single thread slowing the pipeline down
significantly. MeShClust will not run at all, so one of the
clustering steps will be skipped which may decrease the quality of
the motifs inferred. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://autosome.ru/ChIPMunk/">ChIPMunk</a>
is not required for standard operation of SigmoID, but we have found
it very helpful for inference of nonpalindromic motifs. Automatic
ChIPMunk launching within the <i>de novo</i> TFBS inference pipeline
requires setting of the path to chipmunk.jar file in the preferences.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paths to all external programs can be
changed in the preferences. SigmoID will try to set the paths to the
versions installed on your system (via the PATH variable) and will
default to the versions included in the distribution if this fails.</p>
