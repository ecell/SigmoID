   Trifunctional NAD biosynthesis/regulator protein NadR is involved in transcriptional regulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis and salvage genes.
   It controls just two transcription units (nadA and nadR) in Pectobacterium and two more (nadB and pncB) in Dickeya.
   This profile was built starting with RegPrecise data for Pectobacterium atrosepticum and adding sites (matching the characterised regulog) from P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii.
