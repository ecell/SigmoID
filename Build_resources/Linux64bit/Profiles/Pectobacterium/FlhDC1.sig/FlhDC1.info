   The heterotetrameric transcription factor FlhD2C2 is the master regulator of bacterial flagellum biogenesis and swarming migration. It activates transcription overlapping the -35 promoter boxes. The binding site consists from two conserved repeats separated by a variable length spacer, hence two profiles are required for better detection of all binding sites.
   This profile is based on RegulonDB FlhDC sites realigned by MEME and corresponds to the sites with the shorter spacer.
