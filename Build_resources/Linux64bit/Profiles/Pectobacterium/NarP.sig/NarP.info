NarP is nitrate and nitrite responsive transcription regulator. In E.coli most NarP binding sites are also recognised by NarL

hmm profile made of 14 NarP binding sites from Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 present in regPrecise version 3.2 was used to search genomes of Pectobacterium and Dickeya strains. Manually selected sites were added, the resulting alignment was extended by 1 bp from each side. The final profile is built from 54 unique binding sites from six strains and their reverse complements.
