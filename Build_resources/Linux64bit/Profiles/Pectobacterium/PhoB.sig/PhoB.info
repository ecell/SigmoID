PhoB  activates expression of the phosphorus uptake and metabolism genes in response to environmental phosphate and may repress some of the genes for periplasmic proteins. This profile was built starting with E. coli sites described by Blanco et al. (Structure 10: 701â€“713. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(02)00761-x). The original profile was used to search P. atrosepticum 21A genome, and the resulting hits were verified for phosphate-responsive expression by RNA-seq data of Kwenda et al. (DOI 10.1186/s12864-016-2376-0 
) from phosphate starved cultures.  This resulted in just three obvious phosphate-responsive transcription units with upstream PhoB sites. These units include pitA, coding for low affinity Pi transporter (strongly repressed), pstSCABphoU coding for phosphate transport system and phosphate-responsive non-transcriptional regulator (strongly induced) and phoBR coding for the two-component regulatory system (moderately induced).  The final profile includes orthologous sites from P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii.
