   MprA (EmrR) regulates the emrAB and acrAB multidrug efflux pumps. According to RegPrecise 4.0, it binds to a single site in front of operons coding for components of these pumps.  
   This profile was built from 12 sequences from Pectobacterium and Dickeya strains and is shorter by two bases than the RegPrecise profile due to lack of conservation in these positions.
