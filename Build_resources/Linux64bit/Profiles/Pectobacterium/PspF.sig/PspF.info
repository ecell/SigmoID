PspF is an enhancer-binding protein (EBP) required for transcription activation at the RpoN-dependent promoter of the phage shock protein genes (usually two loci per genome).

The profile was built starting with six PspF binding sites from E.coli described in RegulonDB and iteratively adding Pectobacterium/Dickeya sites. 

The final profile is built from 11 non-redundant sites.
