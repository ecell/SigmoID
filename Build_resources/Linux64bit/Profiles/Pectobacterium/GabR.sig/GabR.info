   GabR controls gamma-aminobutyrate utilization and is present in some enterobacteria. In enterobacteria, this regulator and its binding site were computationally predicted and included in RegPrecise 4.0 without experimental confirmation.
    This profile is based on RegPrecise data for Enterobacteriaceae.
