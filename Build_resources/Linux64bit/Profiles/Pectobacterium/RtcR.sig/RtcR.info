RtcR is an enhancer-binding protein (EBP) required for transcription activation at the RpoN-dependent promoter of the rtcBA RNA terminal phosphate cyclase/ligase operon.

The RtcR binding sites in between rtcR and rtcBA in Pectobacterium/Dickeya strains were identified with the help of MEME.

The final profile is built from 5 non-redundant sites and their reverse complements.
