   PecS is a MarR family transcriptional regulator that was shown to control a large group of virulence factors in Dickeya dadantii, including pectate lyases, polygalacturonases, cellulases, harpin and blue pigment indigoidine. A consensus binding site for PecS was suggested by Rouanet et al. (DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M403343200) based on multiple lines of evidence (SELEX, EMSA and DNAse I footprinting). The suggested site, however, has very low information content an HMM/PWM profiles built from the data Rouanet et al. cannot identify even the highest affinity sites.
   Native ligands sensed by PecS in A.tumefaciens, urate and xanthine, have  been identified by Perera and Grove (doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2010.07.053). A recent work of the same authors (doi:10.1002/pro.588) suggested binding site for PecS in both A. tumefaciens and D. dadantii. This site is a 18 bp palindrome with high information content and is different from the one suggested earlier by Rouanet et al.
   The profile in this .sig is based on the work of Perera and Grove and is calibrated to find binding sites in front of pecS and 1-2 efflux transporter genes (pecM and cynX). This profile cannot find any sites in front of pectolytic enzyme genes or their known regulators, even with very low threshold.
