This profile was built starting with experimentally characterised E. coli binding sites and iteratively adding the putative CpxR binding sites from Pectobacteria and Dickeya species. As there's little experimental data for this group of bacteria, a very conservative approach was taken when selecting the sites, therefore the final profile is based on just 16 "certain" sites. Search thresholds are conservative too, and real CpxR regulon is expected to include more genes than this profile can find.
