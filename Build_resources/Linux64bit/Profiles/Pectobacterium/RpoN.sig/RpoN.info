Primary hmm profile built on the basis of the RpoN(sigma54)-dependent E.coli promoters. This profile was used to search various Pectobacterium genomes. The promoters located in front of at least two ortologous genes from different species were used to make the final profile. Only the promoters with a bEBP binding site upsrteam are used in this profile. The final profile is build from 36 unique sequences.
