   The Gluconate repressor, GntR, is a transcription factor that negatively regulates the operon involved in the catabolism of d-gluconate via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and also represses genes involved in two different systems related to d-gluconate uptake: gluconate I and gluconate II. The number of controlled operons varies from 2 to 5 in Pectobacterium/Dickeya strains.
   This profile was built starting with P. atrosepticum GntR sites from RegPrecise 4.0. The matching sites were collected from four Pectobacterium/Dickeya genomes. The final profile is calibrated to hopefully produce no false positive hits.
