MetR is the regulator of methionine metabolism responsive to homocysteine.

hmm profile made of 15 Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 MetR binding sites present in regPrecise version 3.2 was used to search genomes of Pectobacterium strains. 

The final profile is built from 18 nonredundant sequences from Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI 1043, P. carotovorum 3-2 and P. wasabiae SCC3193 and their reverse complements.
