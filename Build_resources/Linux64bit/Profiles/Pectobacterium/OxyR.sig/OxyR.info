OxyR regulates the expression of antioxidant genes in response to oxidative stress, in particular, elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide. The OxyR regulon includes genes involved in peroxide metabolism, redox balance, and peroxide protection.
This profile was built starting with E. coli oxyR sites from RegulonDB. The final version includes 19 sites from Pectobacterium carotovorum, P. atrosepticum, P.wasabiae and D. dadantii
