   UreR (Spro_1420 in RegPrecise 4.0) is the putative regulator of urea carpoxylase and urea transporter genes. It may also control an additional ABC transporter operon in some strains.
   This profile was built starting with the data from RegRpecise 4.0 and adding matching sites from Pectobacterium and Dickeya genomes.
