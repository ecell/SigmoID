HrpS is an enhancer-binding protein (EBP) required for transcription activation at the RpoN-dependent promoter of hrpL, the master regulator of the type III secretion system genes.

The HrpS binding sites in front of Pectobacterium/Dickeya hrpL genes were identified with the help of MEME. 

The final profile is built from 7 non-redundant sites and their reverse complements.
