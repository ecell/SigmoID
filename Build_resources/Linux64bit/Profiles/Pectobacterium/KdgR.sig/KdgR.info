Primary profile was made from 40 experimentally defined sites from Dickeya and Pectobacterium described in Rodionov et al. (Microbiology 150: 3571â€“3590). Final profile is built from these sites extended by 2 bp at each side and the ones found in P. atrosepticum and P. carotovorum 3-2 genomes (85 sites total).
