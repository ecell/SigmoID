   MraZ is a transcriptional repressor involved in the control of cell division and cell wall genes. It has been shown to strongly bind to one site (composed of three short direct repeats) in front of the dcw operon in E. coli and may also have other targets (Erazo et al.; 10.1128/JB.01370-13).

   This profile is built from 7 sequences belonging to Pectobacterium, Dickeya and E. coli strains. With these calibration settings a single site in front of mraZ should be detected.
