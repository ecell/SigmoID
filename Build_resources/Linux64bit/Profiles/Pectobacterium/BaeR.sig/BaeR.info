The BaeRS two-component system activates multidrug transporters in response to indole (and possibly other signals). This profile was built starting with BaeR binding sites described by Nishino et al. (J Bacteriol. 2005 Mar; 187(5): 1763–1772; doi:  10.1128/JB.187.5.1763-1772.2005) and iteratively adding  matching sites from Pectobacterium genomes. 
The final profile is built from 13 Pectobacterium/Dickeya sites. This profile finds binding sites in front of 3-4 multidrug transporter operons in pectobacteria and in front of only one in Dickeya dadantii. Lowering the cutoff below the noise threshold will also find a site in front of mdtDbaeSRsat operon.
