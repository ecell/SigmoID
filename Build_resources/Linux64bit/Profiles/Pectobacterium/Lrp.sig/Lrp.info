   Lrp, Leucine-responsive regulatory protein, is thought to control at least 10% of the genes in Escherichia coli (most of them indirectly). These genes are involved in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism, nutrient transport, pili synthesis, and other cellular functions, including 1-carbon metabolism. In addition, Lrp affects nearly three-fourths of the genes induced upon entry into stationary phase.
   This profile was built starting with E. coli Lrp binding site data from CollectTF. The primary profile was used to search pectobacterial genomes. Pectobacterium-specific profile was constructed from the resulting hits, from which only the sites located in front the genes orthologous to E. coli Lrp-regulated ones according to Cho et al., 2008 (DOI:10.1073/pnas.0807227105) were retained. Finally, several highest scoring hits in front of physiologically relevant genes were used if present in in at least three out of  four genomes of Pectobacterium/Dickeya checked. 
   The threshold in the final profile is set so that all certain orthologues of E.coli Lrp-regulated genes (artP, brnQ, gltB, ilvG, ilvI, livK, oppA, proV, serA) are found.  
   This profile performs sub-optimally for Dickeya.
