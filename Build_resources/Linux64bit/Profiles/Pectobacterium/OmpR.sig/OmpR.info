   OmpR is responsible for adaptation to changes in osmolarity and controls expression of genes coding/responsible for outer membrane porins, flagella, biofilm formation, drug export, increased beta-lactam resistance, etc.
   The OmpR binding site is known to be a direct repeat about 20 bp long, but is otherwise poorly defined. This profile was built starting with RegulonDB and CollectTF data. Search hits from pectobacerial genomes were retained only if the controlled genes belonged to the categories mentioned above or were orthologous to the OmpR-controlled genes described in Shimada et al. (2015; DOI:Â 10.1111/gtc.12282).
   The final profile is built from 95 binding site sequences from several Pectobacterium/Dickeya strains. This profile should not be considered well defined, as the OmpR regulon is rather large and no experimental data for pectobacteria was used. The threshold score is set rather high and this profile will certainly miss some of the true OmpR sites.
