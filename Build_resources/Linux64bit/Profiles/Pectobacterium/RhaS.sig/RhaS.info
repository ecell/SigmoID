RhaS controls rhamnogalacturonan degradation, rhamnogalacturonide transport and rhamnose utilisation.
HMM profile made of 30 RhaS (Enterobacteriales) binding sites from regPrecise version 3.2 was used to search genomes of Dickeya dadantii 3937, Pectobacterium carotovorum 3-2 and P.wasabiae SCC3193.  Sites in front of aldA, rhaB,rhaT,rhiE, rhiT and OA04_21710 of P. atrosepticum SCRI1043 were combined with orthologous sites from the 3937, 3-2 and SCC3193 strains to make the final alignment. The final profile is built of 15 sites.
