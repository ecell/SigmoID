DcuR is known to regulate genes involved in C4-dicarboxylate metabolism.
This profile was built starting with E.coli data from RegulonDB (aligned with MEME) and then searching for the matching sites in pectobacterial genomes. The final profile includes 15 non-redundant sites from Pectobacterium atrosepticum, P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii.
