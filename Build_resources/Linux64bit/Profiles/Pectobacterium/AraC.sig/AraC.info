AraC controls genes involved in arabinose catabolism and transport. The site for this regulator is poorly defined. According to RegulonDB, it is a direct 17 bp repeat, while RegPrecise describes it as a palindrome. In pectobacteria, we could only detect palindromic sites in correct positions and these are represented by this profile. The profile should match only two sites per genome between the divergent araB and araF genes.
