   ExuR negatively controls most of the genes involved in the metabolism of both D-galacturonate and D-glucuronate and binds to the sites similar to the ones recognised by UxuR.
    HMM profile made of ExuR-Enterobacteriales binding sites  present in regPrecise version 4.0 was used to search genomes of Pectobacterium and Dickeya strains. The final profile is extended by 1 bp and is built from 10 non-redundant sequences.
