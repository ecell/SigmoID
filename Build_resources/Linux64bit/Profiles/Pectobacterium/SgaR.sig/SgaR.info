   SgaR is described in RegPrecise as the regulator of the sga operon coding for ascorbate specific PTS system and transaldolase.
   This profile was built starting with RegPrecise data for Pectobacterium atrosepticum and adding orthologous sites from P. carotovorum. P. wasabiae and D. dadantii donâ€™t have the sga genes.
