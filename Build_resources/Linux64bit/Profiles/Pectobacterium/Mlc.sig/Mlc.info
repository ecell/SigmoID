Mlc (also called DgsA) of E. coli controls the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of the phosphotransferase (PTS) system and malT coding for the activator of the maltose regulon. 
In pectobacteria, we have detected orthologous sites in front of ptsH, ptsG and mlc itself. The hmm profile built with these sites confidently finds two additional ones: in front of manXYZ coding for mannose-specific PTS components and pecT (hexA) coding for regulator of motility and virulence. 
The final profile includes sites from P. atrosepticum, P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii.
