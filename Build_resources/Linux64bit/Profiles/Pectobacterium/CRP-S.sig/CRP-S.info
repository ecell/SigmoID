   CRP-S are specialized CRP-dependent promoters that also require the Sxy gene product for expression (Cameron, 2006; Sinha, 2009). The controlled regulon members are related to DNA uptake and metabolism.
   This profile was built starting with E. coli sites described in Sinha et al. (doi:10.1128/JB.00476-09) and includes sites from P. atrosepticum, P. carotovorum. P. wasabiae and D. dadantii.
