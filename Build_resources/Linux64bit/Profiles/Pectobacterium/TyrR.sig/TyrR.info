TyrR controls the genes whose products are involved in the biosynthesis and transport of aromatic amino acids. It has enhancer binding domain, but, contrary to other bEBPs,  regulates transcription initiated by RpoD-containing RNA-polymerase.
The profile was built from RegPrecise data for Pectobacterium atrosepticum by adding matching sequences from P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii.
