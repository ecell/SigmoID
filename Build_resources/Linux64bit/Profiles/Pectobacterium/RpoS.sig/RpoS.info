Primary hmm profile was based on RegulonDB data for E. coli. Since promoter sequences in RegulonDB are not aligned, MEME was used to align them. The alignment resulted in a weak hmm profile centered around the -10 promoter position. This profile was used to search P. atrosepticum 21A genome for similar promoter sequences. For every candidate promoter, we first required that mapped reads started right after it and that the first gene downstream is an orthologue of the corresponding E. coli RpoE regulon member. Candidate promoters matching both criteria were retained and used for constructing Pectobacterium-specific RpoS profile. 

Since highly conserved portion of the profile is rather short, MEME/MAST are very inefficient with it. Only nhmmer should be used with this profile.
