   NrdR negatively controls expression of genes for deoxyribonucleotide reductases. In pectobacteria, it seems to control three nrd operons with two sites in front of each.
   This profile was built starting with RegPrecise data for Pectobacterium atrosepticum and adding orthologous sites from P. carotovorum, P. wasabiae and D. dadantii. The final profile isnâ€™t sufficiently specific; with current threshold it can miss 1-2 weaker sites (but should detect at least one per nrd operon) and may give 1-2 false positives.
