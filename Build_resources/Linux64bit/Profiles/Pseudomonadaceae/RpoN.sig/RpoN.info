RpoN is the sigma-factor controlling nitrogen metabolism. Transcription activation with RpoN containing RNA polymerase depends on an enhancer binding protein being bound upstream.

This profile was built starting with Pectobacterium RpoN-dependent promoters and two rounds of enrichment with Pseudomonas fluorescens sequences. This profile should not be considered fully optimised.
