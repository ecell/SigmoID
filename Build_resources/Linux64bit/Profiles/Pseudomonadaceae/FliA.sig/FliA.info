FliA in the alternative sigma factor required for transcription of chemotaxis/motility genes. Primary hmm profile built on the basis of the FliA(sigma28)-dependent E.coli promoters. This profile was used to search various pseudomonad genomes. The promoters located in front of at least two ortologous genes from different species were used to make the final profile. The final profile is build from 72 unique sequences.
