   Transcription factor PhnR from the GntR protein family regulates the 2-aminoethylphosphonate utilization genes .
   This profile was built starting with RegPrecise 3.0 data. As the alignment in RegPrecise is rather short (12 bp) resulting in low specificity, it was extended by 2 moderately conserved bases on both sides. The final profile is built from binding site sequences from P. fluorescens, P. putida and P. syringae.
