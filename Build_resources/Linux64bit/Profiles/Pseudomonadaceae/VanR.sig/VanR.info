   Transcription factor VanR from the GntR protein family regulates the vanillate utilization genes in some Pseudomonadaceae. In some strains it also controls the vanillate transporter gene vanK.
   This profile was built from RegPrecise 3.0 data. As the original profile was short (12 bp) and not sufficiently specific, we have extended it to 16 bp.
