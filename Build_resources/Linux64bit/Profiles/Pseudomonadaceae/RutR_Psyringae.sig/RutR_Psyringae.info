   RutR belongs to the TetR protein family and controls the pyrimidine degradation pathways and nucleotide metabolism. 
   This profile was built from RegPrecise 3.0 data (combined from four available RutR profiles). As the regulon content differs significantly between different pseudomonads, a universal profile isnâ€™t possible. This profile is optimised for P. syringae and may perform suboptimally for other species.
