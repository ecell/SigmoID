The alternative sigma factor RpoH (sigma32) is the key heat shock response regulator in many Gram negative bacteria. Pecobacterial RpoH1 and RpoH2 profiles were used to search genomes of pseudomonads. Heat shock related hits were collected to build the final Pseudomonas-specific profiles.  Both profiles are sufficiently specific to be used without restricting the search to intergenic regions. 

Both profiles should be used to get full regulon coverage. MAST doesnâ€™t perform well with these profiles, so only nhmmer (the default) is recommended.
