   The two-component system RhpRS was identified in Pseudomonas syringae as a regulator of the genes encoding the type III secretion system and virulence (Deng et al., 2010, 2014). 
   This profile is based on experimental data of Deng et al. (doi:10.1094 / MPMI -23-7-0927 , 10.1093/nar/gku865). However, it doesnâ€™t find one experimentally confirmed site (in front of hrpR) that is thought to be responsible for T3SS regulation.
