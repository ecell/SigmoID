   RutR belongs to the TetR protein family and controls the pyrimidine degradation pathways and nucleotide metabolism. 
   This profile was built from RegPrecise 3.0 data (combined from four RutR profiles present here). The regulon content differs significantly between different pseudomonads. This profile is optimised for P. syringae and may perform suboptimally for other pseudomonads.
