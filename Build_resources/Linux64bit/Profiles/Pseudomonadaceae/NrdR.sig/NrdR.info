   NrdR negatively controls expression of genes for deoxyribonucleotide reductases (nrd). It seems to control two or three operons in Pseudomonadaceae with 1-3 sites in front of each. The sites seem to vary significantly between species, and a single profile doesnâ€™t perform well for all pseudomonads. This one is better suited for plant-associated ones.
   This profile was built from RegPrecise 3.0 data for Pseudomonadaceae.
